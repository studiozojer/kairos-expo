 * Layout scales.

 * Not from daoUI: it publishes colour primitives and semantics only, with no
 * layout layer — `DesignTokens.swift` holds spacing, radius and border in Swift
 * where no non-Swift consumer can read them. Declared here and named as this
 * app's own, which is at least true. Extracting a neutral layout layer is a
 * daoUI change; until it lands, keep these scales identical across the Expo
 * apps.
 *
 * KNOWN DRIFT (board, 2026-08-05): daoUI's `radius` ramp reads 6 in Figma and
 * 8 in code at `md` — offset one rung, undetectable from either side. The
 * verdict is David's. Until it lands, this file follows the CODE ramp.
